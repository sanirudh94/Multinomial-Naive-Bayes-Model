# Multinomial-Naive-Bayes-Model
Hotel Reviews Classifier
Engineered a review classifier to classify the hotel reviews into two categories out of the following four categories: (Truthful or deceptive) and (positive or negative).
1. nblearn.py
- Designed a Naive Bayes Multinomial Classifier which was trained on three folds of data which was referred to as "Training data" and one fold of data was kept aside as the"development data" so as to tune the parameters of the Naive Bayes Classification Model namely priors and Likelihood.
- The output of the nblearn.py is nbmodel.txt that trains the classifier on the training data.
2.nbclassify.py
-Tested the classifier on a random data set known as "test set" and scored an F1 score of 0.91608 using nbmodel.txt as the base.
-The output of nbclassify.py is nboutput.txt which classifies the test set.

The truthful reviews were those that were fetched from authenticated real-world web pages, 'Deceptive' reviews were those that were generated by the system. 'Positive' reviews correspond to the classification of those reviews which were written by the customer who were happy with the hotel service and the 'Negative' reviews were those corresponding to those who were unhappy with the service
